# Zaragoza-HW-Wk18-FitnessTracker

## Description
In this repository you will find files for a simple "fitness tracker" that receives user input to log and save daily workouts. Users add exercises to their workouts along with other pertinent information such as a number of sets and reps for weight/resistance training, or distance goals for cardio. The most recently recorded workout will appear upon loading the application, and user stats from previous workouts are also charted on a dashboard.
